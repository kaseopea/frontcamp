        What is Gulp? One description is that Gulp is a task runner. Another would be that it’s a toolkit for automating time-consuming tasks. Whatever you want to call it, there’s one characteristic that remains true: automation. Let’s dig a little deeper...
        
        Basically, you use Gulp to automate stuff that you would normally have to do manually, such as manually compiling Sass, manually optimizing images, manually refreshing your page in the browser, and so on. Well, these three actions can be consolidated into independent tasks. Then you would take those tasks and have Gulp run them automatically. That's why tools like Gulp and Grunt are called task runners.

        body: `In this tutorial we’ll go through a simple yet effective method for creating an off-canvas menu with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To get an initial idea of what we’ll be building, take a look at the related CodePen demo (check out the larger version for a better experience):
        
        This demo will work well only on desktop browsers. Mobile devices will require a different page layout, but that’s beyond the scope of this tutorial. As usual, we use Babel to compile the ES6 code down to ES5.

The only small issue I encountered while testing it is the text rendering change that happens when the overlay is being animated. Although I tried various approaches proposed in different Stack Overflow threads, I wasn’t able to find a straightforward solution for all operating systems and browsers. So keep in your mind that you might see small font rendering issues as the overlay is being animated.`,
