# EPAM Frontcamp 2017 (Gomel Edition)

## Hometask 3 - webpack
**Mentee - Vitali Rusau**

## Webpack
I have 2 separate webpack configs - one for dev and second for prod.
All source files are placed in ./src folder

commands
* **start** - starts Webpack with preconfigured webpack-dev-sever
* **build** - builds project for dev
* **build-prod** - builds project for production


Additional:
* Used **google-fonts-webpack-plugin** to manage Google Web Fonts and use them locally instead of external resource
* Used **babel-loader** plugin with preset ENV to use ES6 code features

## Additional
Installed **ESLint** (with Aitbnb config) and **jscs**
[eslint with airbnb config](https://www.themarketingtechnologist.co/eslint-with-airbnb-javascript-style-guide-in-webstorm/)
[jscs config](https://www.themarketingtechnologist.co/how-to-get-airbnbs-javascript-code-style-working-in-webstorm/)
